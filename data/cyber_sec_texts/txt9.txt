The Pentagon revealed that the Defense Department travel records suffered a data breach that compromised the personal information and credit card data of U.S. military and civilian personnel.

The data breach could have happened some months ago and could have affected as many as 30,000 workers. The security breach was notified to the leaders on October 4.

“According to a U.S. official familiar with the matter, the breach could have affected as many as 30,000 workers, but that number may grow as the investigation continues. The breach could have happened some months ago but was only recently discovered.” reads the post published by the Associated Press.

“The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the breach is under investigation, said that no classified information was compromised.”

Lt. Col. Joseph Buccino, a Pentagon spokesman, declared the Defense is still investigating the incident, the security breach affected a still unidentified commercial vendor that provided service to Defense Department.

“It’s important to understand that this was a breach of a single commercial vendor that provided service to a very small percentage of the total population” of Defense Department personnel, said Buccino.

“The department is continuing to assess the risk of harm and will ensure notifications are made to affected personnel,” said the statement, adding that affected individuals will be informed in the coming days and fraud protection services will be provided to them.

The department is not identifying the vendor for security reason, it is still under contract, but the department “has taken steps to have the vendor cease performance under its contracts.”
